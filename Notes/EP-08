Class Based Componenets - Older way to building Componenets
Function Componenets - New way to building Componenets.

**Function COmponenets**:
1. Its a normal javascript function and it returns a some piece of JSX code.

**Class Based Component**:
1. Its a javascript class and its have a render method (render()) which returns some piece of JSX code


Life cycle methods:

1. First excute parent component line by line.
2. if see class based component immedietly load the class based component.
3. If class based component is a instance of the class.
4. if classed based component is excute the constructor is called.
5. If constructor is caled then render method is called.
6. If everything excuted finally component did mount method is called.


**Component Did Mount**:
1. Its used to make a api call.

* It is like a **use Effect** in a functional component(it is called after component render completely)

* Loads => render => make API call => render the data

* Component Did Mount also do same thing. It will excute after component completely render.

To study react lifecycle method use below website:

 Componennt mounting has 2 phases:

 1. Render Phase
    - constructor 
    - render
 2. Commit Phase

    - update DOM and refs
    - ComponentDidMount

React is first doing render phase for parent and all the children once complete excute the commit phase for parent and all the children


-----MOUNTING ----
- Constructor (dummy)
- Render (dummy)
- <HTML Dummy >
Component Did Mount
- <API Call>
- <this.setState> State variable is updated

-------- UPDATE -------
 - render (APi data)
 - <HTML (new API data)
 Component Did Update
