 To run project create npm script instad of npm command
How to create script:
    In package.json file under script section add name: function of script:
# Example Script:
 "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "build": "parcel build index.html",
    "test": "jest"
  },

# To run script use below command:
npx parcel index.html => npm run start
npx parcel build index.html => npm run build


JSX:
# Javascript xml = JSX
# The syntax like HTML but not HTML
# eg: const jsxheading = <h1>Dhinesh</h1>
# The above code can't understand the js engine and browser.
# jsxheading = object
# JSX (Transpiled the code before reaches the js engine)
# Transpiled = the JSX code converted to browser understandable code. Its is done by using PARCEL=> Babel

Differ btw react create element and JSX:

# React.createElemnt => react element => js Object => Html Element (render)
# JSX => Bebel convert => React.createElemnt => react element => js Object => Html Element (render)

**Componenent**

1. Functional Component
2. Class Based Component

**Functional component**:

1. it just like a normal javascript function, which returns a piece of JSX.
2. Name function always use capital letter.
3. Function, its returing a react element.its calld function component.

EX:
const ExampleCode = () => {
  return <h1>dhinesh </h1>
}

**Component Composition:**

1. It means one component nested another component its called component composition.

**Mallicious Attack:**

If we use api to get data the attcker can send mallicious data, jsx can sanitze all the data to prevent mallicious attack.
